# ga

A genetic algorithm project for learning Morse code

Individuals given a priori knowledge that Morse code consists of letters with up to 4 dots and/or dashes

Individuals given a random Morse code string and fitness is evaluated on % of characters correctly identified

I was just running it in `irb` with `load 'ga.rb'; ga = GA.new; ga.go`.

You can play with the parameters in top of `ga.rb`
